These pages are intended to capture “lessons learned” and hints by
sites that have run collaboration meetings to help future meetings run
smoothly.

What happens
============

Code Marathons are also called Code Sprints or Hackathons and take
place in some open source projects as a way of making progress on
current development plans, clearing up bug reports and introducing new
developers to the project internals. They usually involve design
discussions between developers, coding (individually or using
techniques like Pair Programming), code testing and debugging, writing
documentation, and coaching for developers who are new to the
code-base. Attendees are encouraged to help others, including
reviewing and possibly testing their proposed code changes.

Previous EPICS Codeathons have attracted between 8 and 35 attendees
from different labs/sites, and have resulted in many useful advances
for EPICS Base and related software. Projects do not have to
contribute directly to the EPICS Base code as long as they are related
to and shared with the EPICS in some way, so work on documentation,
device support, client applications (e.g. CS-Studio) and similar is
all appropriate.

For project selection, the core developers have been generated
projects that can be adopted or discussed in github discussion
areas. It has been okay to also bring your own project and use the
event to interact with colleagues if seeking advice.

Who is invited
==============

The workshop is intended for experienced EPICS users who wish to
contribute towards the future of EPICS, either by writing code or
working on various documentation tasks. There generally are core
developers in attendance to act as mentors as well as members of the
team responsible for developing and maintaining the epics
documentation.

Organization
============

Date selection should be discussed to avoid clashes and secure
participation. Please discuss possible dates with

- EPICS core developers
- Phoebus and services collaboration
- EPICS Council

To secure participation, there should be little overlap with other
collaboration meetings or large conferences.

Recent EPICS codeathons participation has been of around 35
participants, including mentors.

A large room may be able to accomodate the participants in classroom layout.

Some participants may also want to hold separate meetings so it might
be useful to allow for extra break out meeting rooms.

Advertising
===========

Advertise the event on the EPICS tech-talk mailing list, the EPICS
channel on Matrix, professional conferences.

A web page is important to make the event 'official' and allow
permission from labs. A github wiki page in epics-base has been
succesfully used.

Travel arrangements
===================

There may be foreign visitors that may need to know about visas and
may need invitation letters.
